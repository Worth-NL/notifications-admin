<h2 class="heading-medium">Links and URLs</h2>
<p class="bottom-gutter-1-3">
  If the recipient is not expecting to receive an email from you, write the URL in full, starting with https://
</p>
{{ govukInsetText({
  "text": "Apply now at https://www.gov.uk/example",
  "classes": "govuk-!-margin-top-0"})
}}

  To convert text into a link, use square brackets [] around the link text and round brackets () around the full URL. Make sure there are no spaces between the brackets or the link will not work. For example:
</p>
{{ govukInsetText({
  "text": "[Apply now](https://www.gov.uk/example)",
  "classes": "govuk-!-margin-top-0"})
}}
