# Create a government identity logo

A government identity logo is made up of:
* a symbol, for example the Royal Coat of Arms
* text, usually the organisation name

# Upload a logo

If you do not want to use a government identity logo, you can add your own branding in 2 easy steps:
2. Upload a logo.
3. Add alternative text for your logo.

^ Alternative text (alt text) is a written description of an image for users who cannot see it.
