  <h1 class="heading-large">Send files by email</h1>

  <p class="govuk-body">Notify offers a safe and reliable way to send files by email.</p>

  <p class="govuk-body">Upload a file using our API, then send your users an email with a link to download it.</p>

  <p class="govuk-body">To help protect your files you can also:</p>

  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>ask recipients to confirm their email address before downloading</li>
    <li>choose the length of time that a file is available to download</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="govuk-body">Notify uses encrypted links instead of email attachments because:</p>

  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>they’re more secure</li>
    <li>email attachments are often marked as spam</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="govuk-body">This is an API-only feature. You’ll need a developer on your team to set it up for you.</p>

  <p class="govuk-body">To send a file by email, follow the instructions in our <a class="govuk-link govuk-link--no-visited-state" href="{{ url_for('.guidance_api_documentation') }}">API documentation</a>.</p>
