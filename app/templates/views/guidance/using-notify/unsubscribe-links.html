  <p class="govuk-body">Subscription emails must include an unsubscribe link in the body of the message.</p>

  <p class="govuk-body">Transactional emails do not need to include an unsubscribe link.</p>

  <h2 class="heading-medium">How to add an unsubscribe link to an email</h2>

  <p class="govuk-body">GOV.UK Notify uses Markdown to format links.</p>

  <p class="govuk-body">Use square brackets around the link text and round brackets around the URL. Make sure there are no spaces between the brackets or the link will not work. For example:</p>

  <pre class="formatting-example"><code class="lang-md">[Unsubscribe](https://www.gov.uk/example)</code></pre>

  <h2 class="heading-medium">One-click unsubscribe</h2>

  <p class="govuk-body">We are working on adding one-click unsubscribe to GOV.UK Notify. We expect to make this feature available by June 2024.</p>

  <p class="govuk-body">Your emails will still need to include unsubscribe links in the body of the message.</p>
